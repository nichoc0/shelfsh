Yes, this plan is largely doable in Power BI, with some nuances in how certain features are implemented. It will heavily rely on having your data structured correctly, especially for the graph. Python might not be necessary if Power Query and DAX can achieve the data shaping and dynamic elements.

Here's a breakdown of feasibility and how to approach each part:

**1. Data Preparation (Crucial First Step - Likely in Power Query):**

For your graph to work as described (3 lines: Forecast, Actual, Baseline, with dots for milestones over time), you need your milestone data in a "long" (unpivoted) format. You'll need a table that looks something like this:

| PCR# | Title      | Milestone Name | Date Type | Date Value |
| :--- | :--------- | :------------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| P001 | Project A  | RCA            | Baseline  | 2025-01-15 |
| P001 | Project A  | RCA            | Forecast  | 2025-01-20 |
| P001 | Project A  | RCA            | Actual    | 2025-01-18 |
| P001 | Project A  | CB1            | Baseline  | 2025-03-01 |
| P001 | Project A  | CB1            | Forecast  | 2025-03-10 |
| ...  | ...        | ...            | ...       | ...        |
| P002 | Project B  | RCA            | Baseline  | 2025-02-01 |

*   You'll get this by taking your "Milestones Table" (which likely has columns like `RCA Baseline`, `RCA Forecast`, `RCA Actual`, `CB1 Baseline`, etc.) and unpivoting these date columns in Power Query.
*   The `PCR#` and `Title` can be joined from your "PCR HeatMAP" table or be part of this unpivoted table.

**2. Graph (75% of the page):**

*   **Type:** Use a **Line Chart** visual.
*   **X-axis:** Drag your `Date Value` column here. Ensure it's treated as a continuous date axis.
*   **Y-axis:** This is where it's slightly different from your description. A line chart's Y-axis is typically for numerical values that the line represents. In your case, the *lines themselves* represent the different date types (Baseline, Forecast, Actual) over time. The "milestones" (RCA, CB1) will be the *points* or *markers* on these lines.
    *   You won't have "Milestones" as a direct Y-axis category in the typical sense for this type of time-based line chart.
*   **Legend (to create the 3 lines):** Drag your `Date Type` column (which contains "Baseline", "Forecast", "Actual") to the "Legend" field of the line chart. This will create the three distinct lines.
*   **Markers for Milestones:**
    *   Turn on "Markers" in the formatting options for the line chart.
    *   To identify *which* marker is which milestone: The `Milestone Name` column will be used in tooltips. When you hover over a marker, the tooltip can show the `Milestone Name`, `Date Type`, and `Date Value`.
    *   Displaying milestone names directly as labels for each dot on multiple lines can get very cluttered. Tooltips are the standard way.
*   **Title (`PCR#` concatenated with `Title`):**
    *   This requires a DAX measure.
    *   First, ensure your slicers allow selection of a *single* PCR for the title to make sense.
    *   Create a measure like:
        ```dax
        DynamicGraphTitle = 
        VAR SelectedPCR = SELECTEDVALUE('YourTable'[PCR#])
        VAR SelectedTitle = SELECTEDVALUE('YourTable'[Title])
        RETURN
        IF(HASONEVALUE('YourTable'[PCR#]),
           SelectedPCR & " - " & SelectedTitle,
           "PCR Milestone Progress" // Default title if multiple or no PCRs selected
        )
        ```
    *   Then, select your line chart, go to "Format your visual" -> "General" -> "Title", and use the `fx` button to set the title text based on this measure.
*   **Slicers and Multiple Graphs:**
    *   Standard slicers for `Section Chief`, `Platform`, etc., will filter the data for the graph.
    *   **"One big graph holding 75% of the page and if you scroll you'll see more" (for multiple PCRs selected):** A single line chart visual will try to plot all selected PCRs' lines on the *same chart*. This can become very messy if many PCRs are selected.
        *   **Option 1 (Simplest):** Design the page with the expectation that a user typically analyzes one PCR at a time for this detailed graph. The slicers help them pick that one PCR.
        *   **Option 2 (Small Multiples):** In the "Format your visual" pane for the line chart, under "Small multiples," you could drag `PCR#` (or `PCR#` & `Title` combined in a calculated column) to this field. This will create mini versions of the graph for each PCR, which might achieve your "scroll to see more" idea if there are many.
        *   **Option 3 (Report Page Tooltips/Drillthrough):** Not exactly scrolling, but you could have a summary table of PCRs, and then use drillthrough or a report page tooltip to show this detailed graph for a selected PCR.

**3. Dataset Table (remaining 25%):**

*   **"Tabs" (Personnel and Information):** Power BI tables don't have built-in tabs. Here are common workarounds:
    *   **Bookmarks and Buttons (Most Common for "Tabs"):**
        1.  Create two separate table visuals (or two groups of card visuals/text boxes) on your page, one for "Personnel" info and one for "Information" info.
        2.  Position them in the same 25% area, potentially overlapping.
        3.  Create two buttons (e.g., labeled "Personnel" and "Information").
        4.  Use the "Bookmarks" pane.
            *   **Bookmark 1 ("Show Personnel"):** Make the "Personnel" table visible and the "Information" table hidden. Save this state as a bookmark.
            *   **Bookmark 2 ("Show Information"):** Make the "Information" table visible and the "Personnel" table hidden. Save this state as a bookmark.
        5.  Assign the "Show Personnel" bookmark as the action for the "Personnel" button, and "Show Information" for the "Information" button.
    *   **Separate Tables:** Simply have two smaller, distinct tables visible side-by-side or one above the other in the 25% space, clearly labeled "Personnel" and "Information". This is simpler but uses more space if content is sparse.
*   **Data Display:**
    *   The tables (or content switched by bookmarks) would pull fields like `PCR#`, `Section Chief`, `PE`, `Focal`, `Status`, `IWT`, `Top Fleet issues`, etc., from your "PCR HeatMAP" table and potentially your "Milestones Table" (if it contains unique personnel/info data linked to PCRs).
    *   These tables will automatically be filtered by the same slicers affecting the main graph.

**Is it Doable?**

*   **Yes, the core concepts are definitely doable.**
*   The "one graph per PCR, scroll" needs to be implemented using Small Multiples or by managing user expectations to view one PCR at a time for the main detailed graph.
*   The "tabs" in the table require a workaround like bookmarks and buttons.

**Next Steps for You:**

1.  **Data Transformation:** Focus heavily on unpivoting your milestone dates in Power Query to get the "long" format needed for the graph.
2.  **Build the Line Chart:** Start with X-axis (`Date Value`), Legend (`Date Type`). Get the three lines appearing.
3.  **Implement Slicers.**
4.  **Create the Dynamic Title Measure.**
5.  **Address Multiple PCRs in Graph:** Decide between single PCR focus, small multiples, or another approach.
6.  **Build the "Dataset Table" Area:** Choose your method for the "tabs" (bookmarks are recommended for the tab-like feel) and populate the content.

This is an ambitious but achievable design for Page 2! Start with the data structure, as that's foundational.
